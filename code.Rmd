``` {r}
URL<- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
download.file(URL, destfile = "./trainingExercise.csv")
trainingData<- read.csv("trainingExercise.csv", na.strings = "NA", "", " ", "#DIV/0!")
```

after viewing the data, it seems there are a lot of missing values. It would be useful to know how many.

```{r missingValues}
table(is.na(trainingData))
```
as can be seen, almost half of the values are NA. Before we decide what to do with them, we should see if there is a pattern. The metadata describes some of the variables as summary of the data, such as the average and variance, these variables seem to contain the bulk of the missing values. I am only interested in the raw data, so I will remove the variables beginning with `var_`, `avg_`, `stddev_`, `max_`, `min_`, `kurtosis_`, `skewness_`, and `amplitude_`. 

```{r removeColoumns}
trainingDataN<- trainingData %>% select(-starts_with("var"), -starts_with("stddev"), -starts_with("avg"), -starts_with("amplitude"), -starts_with("min"), -starts_with("max"), -starts_with("kurtosis"), -starts_with("skewness"),-raw_timestamp_part_1,-raw_timestamp_part_2,-user_name,-X,-cvtd_timestamp,-new_window,-num_window)
```
I also removed the coloumns with identifying data, such as name and time stamp, as these aren't the predictors we are studying. 

Lets check again how many missing values we have left.

```{r missingValuesCheck}
table(is.na(trainingDataN))
```
They're are no more missing values, which means we have a complete set of data.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
